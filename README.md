# Extendo
This project is concerned with the software development and model of a 6 degrees of freedom robotic arm with 5 revolute joints.

The end goal of this project is to be able to detect wooden blooks within the workspace of the robotic arm(appropriately dubbed, "Extendo"), move the arm to the location of the block, pick it up, and move it to seperate desired location. The enviroment sensor used is a webcam, with some elementary image processing to detect the block posistion. The experiment is realized physically via a remote connection to University of Ottawa lab room.

Please see the project lab reports for details!

Cheers,
Justin Tam
